# Arma3-Tactical-Airlift

A work in progress logistics-based mission using Reaction Forces CDLC context menu and shares similarities to Air Control Mission.

We intend to add an improved focus on ground ops and more configurable parameters.

You can use LLM-context.md to provide LLM models with context for mission development. Note that all models are poorly trained on SQF code and could waste your time if you approach it with a complex SQF scripting task.
